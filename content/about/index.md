My name is Francisco Cardita and I am {{< age >}} years old. I have a degree in [Computer and Informatics Engineering](https://www.ua.pt/en/curso/486), where I learned about software development and design patterns, algorithms, and data structures. During my studies, I worked mainly with `Java`, `Python`, and `C`, and I developed a passion for software development and problem-solving.

I have been working with `React` and `TypeScript` while exploring new technologies and frameworks, such as `Django` and `FastAPI`. `Git` and `Docker` have also been crucial in my development process. Recently, I have developed an interest in Software Architecture, making me eager to learn more about designing scalable and maintainable systems.

In my free time, I **work out** and practice **Boxing** and **Muay Thai**. I also love **filmmaking** and **photography**, alongside **playing musical instruments** and **music production**, which help my urge to create new things and stay creative. Additionally, I value my yearly dose of **traveling** to explore new cultures and landscapes.
